## Homebrew Tap for rds-tunnel
This repository provides the Homebrew formula for rds-tunnel, a Python package designed for creating a secure tunnel to an AWS RDS instance. This tap makes it easy to install and manage rds-tunnel on macOS and Linux systems using Homebrew.

###Â Installation ðŸš€
To install rds-tunnel using Homebrew, follow these two simple steps:

#### 1. Tap the Repository
First, you need to "tap" this Homebrew repository. This tells Homebrew where to find the rds-tunnel formula.
```shell
brew tap sbekx/rds-tunnel
```

#### 2. Install `rds-tunnel`
Once the tap is added, you can install the rds-tunnel package:
```shell
brew install rds-tunnel
```
Homebrew will handle all the necessary dependencies and set up rds-tunnel in an isolated environment.
